# Coinscape

In this app, you can manage your crypto coins portfolio. You can search 1600+ coins that we offer in the app powered by Coin-Routes API. You can buy, sell, and see the daily chart of each of the coins

## Inspiration
We wanted to work on a Crypto Portfolio app, and when we saw the challenge from CoinRoutes, we knew immediately we needed to try to work for that. 

## What it does
In this app, you can manage your crypto coins portfolio. You can search 1600+ coins that we offer in the app powered by Coin-Routes API. You can buy, sell, and see the daily chart of each of the coins

## How we built it
We build it using Flutter, for our backend we use Firebase (using auth, firebase firestore), to fetch the coins, cost calculator, and chart history we use the CoinRoutes API, and to get the icons for the coins we used cryptocurrency-icon API.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a bunch of challenges that I am not going to be able to mention all, but some challenges that we ran into include getting the chart of the coins, getting the icons for the coins, some times it gave us a null return, we work around it by putting the slug of the coin if the image was null. For all the problems we helped each other out with, we seek for help outside and the CoinRoutes team, we also read the documentation.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud because all we did was a two-man team, and we faced a lot of challenges that we were able to overcome, and the thing that we are more proud of is that we had fun building such a cool app, and we gave it our all.

## What we learned
We learned how to work with the CoinRoutes API, we learned how to hurry a project in 2 days, fun stuff, it was our first hackathon, so it was a nice experience. But yeah mostly was how to work better with the APIs in the project and how to be a better developer.

## What's next for Coinscape
We planned to fully finish the features that we were not able to finish, and also to have a more solid app where we do more checks for the data.
